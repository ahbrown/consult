	From: Frosty The Snowman <snowman@cs.brown.edu>
	To: $full_name <$user@cs.brown.edu>
	Subject: Snow Warning

	Hello,

	Please Note: This message was automatically generated because you
	were caught throwing snow by the Sunlab consultant '$CONSULTANT'.

	You should not throw snow, as there are unscrupulous users who
	will promptly throw snow right back at you.

	Furthermore, under department policy you are responsible for
	not having fun in the labs! By throwing snow, you are in clear
	violation of this rule, and must cease having fun upon reception
	of this e-mail.

	Thank you,

	Frosty the Snowman
	Snow Daemon
	Department of Computer Science
	Brown University
	(on behalf of the consulting program)
